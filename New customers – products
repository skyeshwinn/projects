Project Name: New customers – products
Company: Bass Pro Shops
Duration: 2 weeks
Project timeline: September 2023

Situation: 
I recently observed the increase in sales across some of the products in various categories (both new and old products) and I wanted to perform a deep dive analysis of whether new customers 
had a major role to play in this. Since advertising (esp. digital) has been crucial in terms of budget allocation of which advertising to go ahead to spend, I took ownership of this project 
by proposing this idea to the Direct of Digital Marketing and the Director of Marketing about how our best-selling products have been purchased by new customers as opposed to customers that’ve purchased before.

Task:
To classify these products based on different parameters such as 
•	% of styles purchased by new customers w.r.t. those purchased by existing customers
•	% of sales from the styles purchased by new customers w.r.t. those from the sales of existing customers
•	% of styles which where only purchased for the first time only w.r.t. all the styles purchased by new customers
•	% of sales from the styles which where only purchased for the first time only w.r.t. all the sales from the styles purchased by new customers
•	% of sales that were subsequent purchases by new customers w.r.t. all the sales from the styles purchased by new customers
•	% of styles that were purchased on their own by new customers w.r.t. all the styles purchased by new customers
•	% of sales from styles that were purchased on their own by new customers w.r.t. all the sales from the styles purchased by new customers

Action:
• Products -> Styles since they’re better to analyze in terms of data.
• Type of customer -> New customers (those whose FIRST_PURCHASE_DATE of product purchase is less than 1 year), existing customers (those whose FIRST_PURCHASE_DATE of the product purchase is more than 1 year).
• Time period analysis -> last 1 year
• Channels -> Retail and Internet
• Total styles -> 215k, Styles that were purchased by both new and existing customers -> about 106k
• Retail + Internet -> 96k styles
• SQL queries for these logic -> 
    •	Styles from existing customers
    •	FIRST_PURCHASED_DATE 
    •	Styles from new customers
    •	Styles from new customers whose styles were purchased for the first time only.
    •	Styles from new customers whose styles were purchased on itself.
• Based on the above logic, I used sales and count of customers. One of the key parameters of figuring out how much a product is valuable is to find out the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) -> Customer sales per customer.
• Created temp tables based of this logic and combined them into a larger final query.
• Exported the result into a CSV file to figure out the % calculated parameters. Used this large CSV file to perform clustering using the Machine Learning algorithm in Jupyter notebook.
• Before doing the clustering, I took only the % parameters since they were of the same kind of value. As a result of applying the clustering algorithm, these styles got segregated into different clusters. 

Result:
Certain high selling products were in different clusters only becoz they varied in some of the % parameters that I mentioned. I then prepared a Powerpoint Presentation highlighting the differences in the clusters 
of these styles. This recommendation helped them push towards spending more in pushing new customers through appropriate campaigns. Out of top 100 selling styles in last 1 year, sizable number of them for a 
particular cluster came from more contribution towards new customers. If we keep pushing to sell these top styles, we could bring in as much as 20% more sales YoY.
