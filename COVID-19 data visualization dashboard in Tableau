•	All the visualizations here are dynamic in nature, i.e. you can change the date, case type (confirmed/death) and in some models, the country and state
•	Also, hover over these (place your mouse upon) to view more info. I have created these charts assuming that the data is correct
•	I have built a storyboard dashboard showcased about 30 visualizations about the stats associated with the COVID-19 crisis along with a few parameters affecting it


Parameters:
o	Case count standing by country & US state – Scatter bubble plot
o	Single day vs Overall cases ranked by country & US state – Butterfly chart
o	Flattening the curve, comparison by country & US state – Combination of area, line time series chart
o	Peak determinator by country & US state – Waterfall chart
o	Per day increase, Deaths per 1 million people, Healthy people/infected cases – Table chart
o	Distribution of COVID across USA states, China Provinces and European countries – Tree map
o	Second wave of COVID in Japan, Singapore – Line chart
o	Population by case ratio in Europe & US States – Hexagonal representation in map form
o	Testing rates by US state – Clustered bar chart
