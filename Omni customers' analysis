Project Name: Omni customers' analysis
Company: Bass Pro Shops
Duration: 1-2 weeks
Project timeline: April 2023

Situation:. Reason is to understand omni cust. purchase behavior more and also to see where to spend in terms of marketing channel

Task: Analyze the impact of omni customers over the past 1 year

Action:
Omni channel – both retail + direct purchase – atleast 1 each in last 1 yr
a) total no. of customers in last 1 yr & % of omni to total customers
b) total no. of omni customers by cust type (rewards, non-rewards,club) & % of these omni cust to total customers
c) total no. of omni customers by dept (100,151,175,…800) & % of these omni cust to total customers
d) total. No of direct cust. by marketing channel (natural search,paid search,affiliates,paid social media, etc) & % of omni to total customers
Parameters – revenue, transactions, cust. count
Metrics – revenue /cust, revenue /transactions aka AOV, transactions/cust. count
For c) and d), I also calculated 2 things – first purchase & subsequent purchase – to see the trend across advertising/marketing channels

Result: Omni cust. contributing more for direct (30% more potential push for sales through only direct), also good contribution through retail (12-15% more potential push through only retail)
