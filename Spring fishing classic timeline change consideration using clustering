Project name: Spring fishing classic timeline change consideration using clustering
Company: Bass Pro Shops
Duration: 1-2 weeks
Project timeline: August 2023

Situation: Based on this year’s Spring Fishing Classic event, to improve customer experience and to bring in more sales, there was an consideration proposed from the retail 
managers whether there should be a shift in the timeline for certain stores and if so, which are those to be considered.

Task: 
To find out 2 things:
•	Is there a need to consider changing the timeline for the Spring Fishing Classic for certain stores?
•	If so, which are they? How do we find out 

Action:
•	There are 172 stores in the US + Canada. I have had to look at all the stores sales to perform the analysis.
•	Time period -> Jan to Apr (21 weeks)
•	Visualized 2 parameters in Power BI – WoW sales and WoW revenue diff% for all states & all stores. Key is to study the sales curves and determine what’s the correct parameter.
•	Zeroed on sales profile -> % of week sale for every week w.r.t. total sales for that store across 21 weeks
•	Exported the data in the form of CSV file. Imported in python. After excluding other variables and creating index column as store number, created pivot table to performed k-means clustering. 
•	Found 4 different clusters.

Result:
•	Stores along S.Florida and few stores in Great Plains in different cluster.
•	Based on their sales profile and sales, I was able to deliver results in the sense that I recommended that these stores have a week/2 week shift in timeline for next year’s Spring fishing classic event.
•	Got sign-off from manager and Director. Spoke to distribution team regarding this. They will implement this during start of next year.
•	Assuming that there’s same sales next year, I estimated that there will be 12-15% more overall revenue in all stores.
